# NIR-spectra_of_manure
Combined with multivariate calibration methods, near- infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a non-destructive, rapid, precise and inexpensive analytical method to predict chemical contents of organic products.
The objective of this project is to:
- Build a classification model to distinguish between cattle and poultry manure.
- Develop a prediction model for the chemical compounds present in the manure from cattle and poultry.
